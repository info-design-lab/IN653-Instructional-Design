      <h3>Course Overview</h3>

      <p> TBD Information graphics reveal the hidden, explain the complex and illuminate the obscure. Constructing visual representation of information is not mere translation of what can be read to what can be seen. It entails filtering the information, establishing relationships, discerning patterns and representing them in a manner that enables a consumer of that information construct meaningful knowledge.</p>

      <p> TBD Recent advances in technology have enabled us with means for creating, recording and analysing incredible amounts of data. Where once data was scarce, it is now available in abundance. The field of Computer Science has made great strides in creating capabilities for data handling and analysis. However the techniques required to most effectively display and communicate data are somewhat neglected. This design course aims to fill the gap by teaching techniques for creating effective visualizations based on principles from graphic design, visual art, perceptual psychology, and cognitive science.</p>

      <h3>Course Objectives</h3>

      <p>This course will provide students with the foundations necessary for understanding and extending the current state of the art in data visualization. By the end of the course, students will be able to: 
            <ul>
            <li>Gain an understanding of the key techniques and theory used in visualization, including data models, graphical perception and techniques for visual encoding and interaction.

            <li>Plan for data-based storytelling through charts, maps, and diagrams.

            <li>Gain practical experience building and evaluating visualization systems.

            <li>Gain the ability to read and discuss research papers from the visualization literature.
      </ul>

      </p>

      <h3>Course Contents</h3>

        <p>In formal learning environments such as classrooms, learners are too often positioned as passive — listening, watching, attending, consuming — rather than encouraged to engage as creators — designing, making, producing, constructing.</p>
        <p>During the first week of this course, we will (1) investigate the theoretical foundations of learning by creating, and (2) explore how to design learning experiences and technologies that support creating as a central activity.</p>
        <p>We do this by focusing on constructionism, a theory of learning developed by Seymour Papert. Constructionism builds on the constructivist theories of Jean Piaget, asserting that knowledge is not simply transmitted from teacher to student, but actively constructed by the mind of the learner. Papert wrote in 1991:
</p>
        <p>Constructionism shares constructivism’s connotation of learning as ‘building knowledge structures’ irrespective of the circumstances of the learning. It then adds the idea that this happens especially felicitously in a context where the learner is consciously engaged in constructing a public entity, whether it's a sand castle on the beach or a theory of the universe.</p>
        <p>Our investigations and explorations will be supported through readings, and a group assignment with construction-oriented learning experiences to experiment whether learners are likely to make new ideas when they are actively engaged in making some type of external artifact, which they can reflect upon and share with others.</p>
